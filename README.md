Aim: To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

Apparatus: Online Compiler C++

Theory: 
Program-1: This program demonstrates various bitwise operations in C++. Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representations of integers at the bit level.

Bitwise AND (&): Performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits
Bitwise OR (|): Performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits
Bitwise NOT (~): Performs a logical NOT operation on each bit (flips all bits)
Bitwise XOR (^): Performs an exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits
Left Shift (<<): Shifts all bits to the left by the specified number of positions
Right Shift (>>): Shifts all bits to the right by the specified number of positions

Program-2: This program demonstrates how to set (turn to 1) and reset (turn to 0) a specific bit in an integer (n = 12) using bitwise operations. Bitwise OR (|) → Sets a bit to 1. Bitwise AND (&) + NOT (~) → Resets a bit to 0.

Conclusion: Hence, we performed the Bitwise Operations on numbers given as input and we have reset and set the given digits of a binary number.
